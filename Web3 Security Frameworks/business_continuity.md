# BNB Chain - Web3 Security Framework

### Business Continuity Best Practices Checklist

Classification: **Restricted**

**Stage: Publication stage (60)**

**Introduction**:

The Web3 Security Framework Initiative is a collaborative effort to promote the adoption of best practices in web3 security. The initiative aims to minimize the risks associated with security vulnerabilities and hacks, which have become increasingly prevalent in the web3 space. Moreover, projects that demonstrate full compliance with our rigorous guidelines will earn an on-chain certificate recognized by all the AvengerDAO members on the BNB Chain ecosystem.

This document serves as a comprehensive checklist of the critical elements surrounding Business Continuity best practices.

Such strategies may include maintaining a reserve fund, substantial enough to support the business operations and associated expenses for at least a year, which is the typical duration of a bear market.</td>

These measures should incorporate 1) prompt and effective communication with the community, 2) restitution plans informed by factors such as the cash amount lost in the hack, and the process of compensation for the impacted users. Additionally, 3) strategize plans to quickly reduce hack-induced damages, strategies that may entail a temporary halt of crucial operations.</td>

This plan should involve 1) Risk Assessment to identify and evaluate potential risks due to price fluctuations; 2) Preventative Measures, which are strategies aimed at reducing the potential negative impacts on business operations derived from market instability; and finally, 3) Response and Recovery procedures including operational responses and sound liquidity management to reinforce the continuous operation of the business.</td>

    <td>Set up a system to identify and keep track of liquidity pools that utilize the project token and regularly evaluate their associated risks. This should involve noting the DEX liquidity pools' addresses, determining the current pool values, establishing an acceptable percentage for liquidity changes before intervention is needed, counting the existing LP tokens and examining the amount of locked liquidity, if applicable. A Risk Matrix system can be used to evaluate associated risks, considering multiple factors such as the duration LP tokens are locked, the sufficiency of liquidity for every pool, and connections between liquidity and other primary contracts. As a guiding principle, ensure the liquidity pools monitored do not carry high-risk status.</td>

These guidelines should also incorporate contingency plans to manage and mitigate risks in scenarios where operations deviate from the norm due to unforeseen circumstances. These contingency plans should outline a clear response framework detailing necessary actions and responsible personnel.</td>

    <td>Put together actionable contingency plans for each potential risk. This involves analyzing all facets of the business to catalogue possible uncertainties and vulnerabilities. For each identified risk, establish guidelines and procedures to prevent, minimize, or effectively respond to its occurrence. This should include a clear chain of command, specific tasks assigned to individuals or teams, and, if needed, resource allocation for managing the situation.</td>

To reduce dependence risks inherent to partnerships, guarantee the partner project's security and assess the level of engagement with the partner undertaking. Essential to this process is the establishment of clear contingency plans and standard operating procedures through communication with downstream partners. It is vital to meticulously document these procedures and routinely review them to ensure their efficacy.</td>
